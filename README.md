# Shared Wallet
A wallet which is owned by an address which can give non-owners permission to withdraw a limited amount of funds (Allowance). The allowance can be changed by the owner. Anyone can deposit funds into this wallet.

## TODO
1. Separate contracts into Allowance and ShareWallet and place them in different files.
2. Add events for receiving and sending money.
3. Use smart math instead of regular subtraction.
